# Spring Boot in Action Sample Code

This repository contains example code from Spring Boot in Action. In as much as is possible when writing compilable/verifiable code to be injected into a not-easily-verifiable work of prose, the code should be aligned with what was printed. There may be slight variations, however.

This code will be tagged with FIRST_PRINTING to indicate that the code aligns with the first printing of the first edition of the book. This allows for further evolution of the code after publication while still maintaining a reference back to the code as it aligns with the printed book.

Please feel free to offer suggestions in the form of pull requests if you see opportunity for improvement.
